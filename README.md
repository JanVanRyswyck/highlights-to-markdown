## Introduction

This repo is a fork of [highlights-to-markdown](https://gitlab.com/jpallares/highlights-to-markdown) on Gitlab. Thanks [Juan Pallar√®s](https://gitlab.com/jpallares)!

Here is the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) after forking.

## Features

Node app to parse your Kindle (My Clippings.txt) or O'Reilly highlights and create a Markdown file per book grouping the quotes.

The quotes are grouped by Chapter (O'reilly) or Page (Kindle). The books have the date of the most recent quote assigned.

The script will attempt to get metadata from [O'reilly Search API](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/integration-docs/search.html#/), fallback to [openlibrary.org](https://openlibrary.org/) if failure.
