## Highlights

### 1. Management 101

"Your manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team’s goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work. The most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of the company." | [2022-10-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781491973882/ch01.html#32626098-801f-43ee-a2aa-9497fe81f40f)

"Asking your manager for advice is also a good way to show that you respect her. People like to feel helpful, and managers are not immune to this sort of flattery." | [2022-10-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781491973882/ch01.html#ac01ea28-fe7d-43d5-aa71-a9b316327c9e)

"managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something" | [2022-10-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781491973882/ch01.html#34b8167a-9405-4584-a611-d412d443d93b)
